# BIS-205-Final-Project
This was a final project for BIS 205 at Eastern CT State University Spring 2025

This is an information system designed in Microsoft Excel called EZ Ticketz that is used for tracking ticket sale data and metrics for events. 
This system would be used by concert planners, event coordinators, and managers. The system tracks revenue, ticket inventroy, and general ticket information including date of sale, tickket ID number, price of ticket, section and seat nunber of ticket, etc. 
Our project allows busiensses to answer questions like, what date where the most tickets sold on? What percentage of ticekts are avialable, reserved, or sold? How much potential revenue remains to be made? 
In Excel we implimented different functionality such as COUNT, SUMM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX. We also used pivot tables to display clear visualizations between trends in our data. Additionally, conditional formatting was implemented for different data metrics such as data bars, and color formatting.
